# Contribution guidelines

Hi! Thanks for contributing to the nf-co2footprint plugin for Nextflow üòä

Please read the following to help us maintain and ensure high-quality code.

## üíÖ Follow commit style

Commits should be structured like this: `<Type>: <Message>`, with the following types:

- `Feature` representing an enhancement or new functionality
- `Fix` when addressing a bug
- `Documentation` when mainly improving comments, documentation files or docstrings
- `Refactor` when moving stuff or changing naming, but essentially making no functional changes
- `CI` when changing the continuous integration (guidelines, templates,...)
- `Chore` when just doing something that has to be done once in a while or relates to other changes

## üñãÔ∏è Signing commits
When submitting a pull-request (PR), please sign-off the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) to certify that you are the author of the contribution and you adhere to [Nextflow's open source license](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/blob/master/COPYING) by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to the contribution commit message. See [here](https://github.com/apps/dco) for more details.

## üö© Github's issue tracking
- When opening a pull-request that connects to an Issue, please mention it in the opening comment.
- Assign labels / types to PRs / issues when possible

## üèóÔ∏è Create draft pull-requests
- This tells us that you are working on something, even during early stage of development. Don't worry about everything being perfect already, that's what it's for.
- If you are unable to finish the PR, someone may easily pick up the work where you left off.

## üí¨ Comment your code
Use docstrings ...

...for methods:
```groovy
/**
* The recreates an iconic greeting.
*
* @param The name of the greeted person
* @param The voice of the second character represented by number
* @return The greeting
*/
static def writeGreeting(String name, Integer voice=null) {
  String voiceType = switch(voice) {
      case 0 -> 'happy'
      case 1 -> 'evil'
      default -> 'robotic'
  }
  String greeting = """\
  - ${name}: Hello there...
  - Grievous: [${voiceType} voice] General ${name}!
  """.stripIndent()

  return greeting
}
```

...for classes:
```groovy
/**
* This class creates dialogues.
*/
class Dialogues extends Scene {
  ...
}
```

Use one line comments for variables
```groovy
final answer = 42 // This variable contains the answer to the sense of life itself
```


## ‚òëÔ∏è Unit testing

Run unit test frequently to notice faulty code early on. For that purpose also try to keep them brief (i.e. mock as little as possible).

To run your unit tests, run the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):
```bash
./gradlew check
```
