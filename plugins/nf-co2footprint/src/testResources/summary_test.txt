Total CO2e footprint measures of this workflow run (including cached tasks):
CO2e emissions: 6.53 g
Energy consumption: 13.61 Wh

Which equals:
- 0.037 km travelled by car
- It takes one tree 5h 12min 19.21s to sequester the equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere
- 0.013 % of a flight from Paris to London

The calculation of these values is based on the carbon footprint computation method developed in the Green Algorithms project.
